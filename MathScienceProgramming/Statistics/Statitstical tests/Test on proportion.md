Consider large n (sample size)
We assume that null hypothesis is a given a proportion known a priori

The usual procedure is pretty standard for statistical tests:
- Define null and alternative hypothesis
- Calculate Z score under H0 :

$$
Z = \frac{\hat \mu - \mu_0}{\sigma_0 / \sqrt n}
$$
Where 

$$
 \mu_0 - known\ proportion , \ \hat \mu - sample \ proportion, \ \hat \sigma - sample \ standard \ deviation, \ n - sample size
$$

- Find p-value depending of type of hypothesis and intepret it

### Important

Variance of binominal distribution :

$$
\sigma ^ 2 = p(1-p)
$$

and 

$$
\sigma_0 ^ 2 = p_0(1-p_0)
$$
